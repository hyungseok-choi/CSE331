# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of node
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge e3 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e4 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1) n1(e2) n2(e3) n2(e4)
